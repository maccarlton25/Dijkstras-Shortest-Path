# Dijkstra-SPA
 
Summary

In this assignment you will use your basic graph data structure to solve an important graph problem. Write a Java program that implements Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm. The algorithm will use as input two things:
a connected directed graph with weights on the edges (it may have cycles)
a single vertex, the start vertex
For each vertex V in the graph, Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from the start vertex to V (including start vertex to itself, with path length 0).

You MAY USE the Java Collections library for this assignment. You may want lists, queues, hashmaps, etc. You will need a priority queue to make Dijkstra's algorithm efficient. Use your own ADT's or use the Java collections versions, your choice. Write your own graph code and your own Dijkstra's code.
